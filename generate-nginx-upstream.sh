#
# Generates the per-worker nginx config from NUM_WORKERS at container start
# (the worker count arrives via the runtime env file, from the API registry,
# and is not known when the image is built, so it can't be baked into
# nginx.conf). The same value ServerEnv.numWorkers reads; a disagreement here
# is not a fallback: too few upstreams and the workers nginx never lists get
# no traffic, too many and it proxies to ports nothing listens on.
# Emits two things, both in the http context, into a single conf.d file:
#
#   1. upstream openfront_workers  - random-balanced across the live workers, so
#      nginx can spread requests (e.g. POST /api/create_game) without the caller
#      knowing the worker count.
#   2. map $worker $worker_port    - worker index -> port (3001 + index), so the
#      /wN/ locations route without a hand-maintained if-ladder.
#
# Usage: generate-nginx-upstream.sh [output_path]
