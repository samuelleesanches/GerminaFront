# Which one is right depends entirely on whether the deployment is long-lived,
# and that is what SUBDOMAIN tells us:
#
#   Long-lived, listed below. Something depends on these being reachable at a
#   fixed hostname without anyone watching. `main` and `nightly` are both
#   staging deployments people test against; `nightly` is here because a
#   scheduled deploy is the only thing that would otherwise restart it, so a
#   crash at 07:05 UTC is a ~24-hour outage rather than a blip (OPE-361).
#   `green` and `blue` are the dev pools the same schedule fans out to, with
#   the exact same exposure -- worse, actually, since start.sh caps every
#   non-main dev container at 25h, so without `always` a single missed nightly
#   would leave them dead until the next successful one. Any deployment on the
#   production domain qualifies for the same reason and is matched separately,
#   since its subdomain is not fixed.
#
#   Everything else: a per-branch preview. deploy.yml deploys EVERY push on
#   EVERY branch to <branch>.openfront.dev, so these accumulate one container
#   per branch anyone has ever pushed. `no` is what lets them die quietly --
#   with `always` a host reboot would resurrect months of abandoned branch
#   containers, each holding its memory and its worker processes, and nothing
#   would ever clean them up. Their owner is present when they are deployed and
#   can redeploy, which is exactly the case `no` is for.

# Tell the API which commit new players of this site should get. This is the
# single switch of multi-server v2 (docs/MultiServer.md): servers running
# `latest` are `open` and take new games, everything else drains, and the
# static Worker serves `latest`'s page at <site>/ and its /desktop/*.json.
#
# It runs LAST, after the new container is up, because the API refuses to flag
# a version no server has checked in for — that refusal (409) is the interlock
# that stops a deploy from pointing every player at a build that cannot serve
# them. The container registers within ~10s of boot, so a 409 immediately after
# `docker run` is expected and is retried, not an error. There is no separate
# health wait in this script; this retry loop is the closest thing to one, and
# CI's own "Wait for deployment to start" step polls /commit.txt afterwards.
