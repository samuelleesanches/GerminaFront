/**
 * Doomsday Clock (anti-stall). Once armed, every side must hold a rising
 * share of the whole map: each player in FFA, each whole team in team modes (so
 * a team is judged on its combined territory and every member shares the fate).
 * The bar is the SAME for every side regardless of headcount — the clock shrinks
 * the number of viable SIDES, and sides are the unit of elimination/victory, so
 * a team faces exactly the bar a solo player faces. (It was previously scaled by
 * member count, which saturated at "hold the whole map" right after the grace in
 * real team lobbies and dropped whenever a teammate died — deciding games at
 * ~minute 12 on the slow preset instead of acting as a late-game backstop.)
 * The bar rises in discrete waves (battle-royale zone), stepping up to each
 * wave's level (chosen by the speed preset, see DoomsdayClock.ts) and holding. As
 * it rises the bottom is cut, which forces consolidation and guarantees a finish.
 *
 * A side below the bar is marked (inDoomsdayClock -> blinking skull) and, after
 * the warn window, bleeds troops (and warship health) down to a decaying floor.
 * Climbing back above the bar clears the mark and stops everything below.
 *
 * Once the floor bottoms out, TERRITORY ROT takes land until the side dies. The
 * drain alone never kills, so without rot a stalemate outlives the final wave
 * with every challenger crippled but unkillable. Timings in Config.ts.
 *
 * Deterministic: every value the sim stores is an integer — the threshold is one
 * floored ratio (see DoomsdayClock.ts), the drain and floor are floored
 * percentages, and quotas are exact ceilings over integers. Tile choices come from
 * integer hashes of the tile, salted per player — no PRNG state and no floats. Off
 * unless enabled in the GameConfig. Runs once per second (every 10 ticks), like
 * WinCheckExecution.
