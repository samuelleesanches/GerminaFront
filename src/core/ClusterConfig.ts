// entries keyed by instance letter, each naming a host and its worker count
// (docs/MultiServer.md). The letter is the first character of every game id
// the server mints, which is how a game id names its server for the rest of
// its life — so letters are append-only: retiring a server means draining it
// and never reusing its letter for a different host.
//
// This is no longer configuration. A server knows only ITSELF — its letter,
// game host and worker count arrive in its env (INSTANCE_LETTER, GAME_HOST,
// NUM_WORKERS; docs/MultiServer.md, "Server identity") — and ServerEnv.cluster
// synthesizes a one-entry map from them for the page it renders. The fleet
// as a whole is the API registry's list
// (src/core/ServerList.ts), which clients read; the one-entry map is the
// page's fallback when that list is unavailable.
