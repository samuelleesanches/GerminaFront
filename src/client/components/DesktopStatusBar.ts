 * anyway. Reachability outranks the update because an update failure while
 * the backend is unreachable is a SYMPTOM of it: "Couldn't download the
 * update -- Retry" points at a button that provably cannot work until the
 * network comes back, while "Offline" names the actual cause.
 *
 * One signed-out reason breaks the session > reachability half of that order:
 * `needs-account`'s own remedy is itself a network call, so while the backend
 * is unreachable it is really a symptom of reachability too. See the
 * exception carved out at the top of the function below.
 *
 * `backendOutage` is the DEBOUNCED signal
 * (ServerList.backendUnreachableConfirmed()), and it is only ever true on
 * desktop -- the bar renders nothing on the web, so the component never
 * tracks it there. Nothing is shown while the heartbeat is merely unsettled
 * or has missed once: there is no neutral state in this bar to hang a
 * "Checking…" on, and inventing one would put a strip across the bottom of a
 * perfectly healthy game every time a single request timed out.
