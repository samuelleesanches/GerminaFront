 *
 * `failed` is not one case but four, and the remedy rule splits them:

 *   - `verify`  -- the CDN's bytes did not match the descriptor's sha256:

 *                  real remedy, AND we know for certain a newer version exists,
 *                  because we successfully parsed the descriptor naming it. A
 *                  client sitting on a known-stale version with a working
 *                  remedy is the strongest case for gating there is. GATE.
 *   - `refused` -- our OWN Cloudflare WAF answering 403 (OPE-192).
 *   - `parse`   -- a descriptor from our own server that we could not read.
 *
 * The last two are deterministic and entirely server-side: no player-side
 * action changes the outcome, so Retry re-runs the identical failure. Gating
 * them locks the player out while showing a button that provably cannot help,
 * which is the same punishment-without-recourse `blocked` avoids. DO NOT GATE.
 *
 * Takes the whole state rather than the bare status because the error kind is
 * load-bearing in that decision.
 *
 * This mirrors multiplayerAllowed in openfront-desktop's
 * src/main/update/state.ts. The two repositories cannot import from each other;
 * if you change the rule, change it in both. Both are covered by tests
 * asserting all four error kinds.
 *
 * The one place the two DELIBERATELY differ is the unrecognised-kind branch
 * below, which has no counterpart in the shell. The asymmetry follows from
 * which direction the values travel: THE CLIENT MAY RECEIVE FROM A NEWER
 * SHELL, BUT THE SHELL CANNOT RECEIVE FROM A NEWER CLIENT. The shell only
 * ever classifies errors it raised itself, against a closed union, so an
 * unrecognised kind is unreachable there by construction. Do not "restore
