// the TEMPORARY#### rename prompt, the unclaimed-name prompt this module adds,
// the reservation lapse notice, and the unclaimed-rewards popup. Main.ts
// resolved the first two against each other with a bare `return` and the third
// did not participate at all — it fires from inside <username-input>, on its
// own listener, and neither side could see the other. Two overlays on one boot
// was a matter of which states happened not to co-occur.
//
// So: one ordered rule, expressed over plain values. Main.ts asks once and acts
// on the answer, which makes the ordering testable without a DOM and leaves one
// place to add the fifth contender.

 * 3. Still due afterwards means nothing was written, so nothing was said.

 *    free only until they spend it. Most urgent, and it was already first.
 * 2. `grant-welcome` — a Steam month is running and nobody has said what it
 *    is. Ahead of the claim prompt because the claim prompt asks the buyer to
 *    use a perk of a thing they have not yet been told they own; a player who
 *    does not know the month is a one-off reads every later prompt as a
 *    subscription they never agreed to. It fires once per grant.
 * 3. `username-claim` — entitled, no name at all. The perk is running down
 *    unused and nothing else in the client will ever mention it, which is the
 *    whole reason this prompt exists.
 * 4. `lapse-notice` — a name they already hold is running out. Below the
 *    above only because it repeats: it re-arms on the phase change and speaks
 *    again next launch, whereas the claim prompt decays and stops. It has
 *    already spoken by the time this is asked (see lapseShownAfterDispatch),
 *    which is why the grant sign-off cannot rank above it and instead the
 *    notice itself carries the after-grant wording for a former grant holder.
 * 5. `grant-ended` — the Steam month ran out and nothing said so. Nothing is
 *    at risk, but every day it goes unsaid is a day the player believes they
 *    are about to be charged. Marks itself shown when the lapse notice covers
 *    it, so a former grant holder with a reserved name hears it once.
 * 6. `rewards` — money already in the account. Nothing is at risk and it
 *    survives to the next load unchanged, so it always yields.
 *
 * 1 and 3 are mutually exclusive by state (a TEMPORARY#### rename IS a name),
 * as are 3 and 4 (`premium` versus `claimed`). The order is stated anyway
 * rather than resting on that staying true — those exclusions are properties of
 * today's server, not of this rule.
