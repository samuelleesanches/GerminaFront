// Homepage "featured stream" panel: embeds a Twitch channel and shows ONLY while it is
// actually live, then hides. Data comes from the shared streams feed (GET /streams.json,
// with a bundled empty fallback in resources/streams.json): `featured` is a list of
// verified-live broadcasts in admin priority order (e.g. the OFM channel for tournaments
// ahead of the OF channel for releases). Empty = nothing to show (renders nothing).
//
// Liveness is decided server-side: the API polls Twitch Helix on a cron and serves only
// broadcasts that are live right now, each carrying a `startedAt` no static config could
// produce. So `featured[0]` is simply what to embed. The client used to work this out
// itself by mounting a real autoplaying Twitch.Player per configured channel and reading
// its ONLINE/OFFLINE events, which cost ~300 Twitch requests on every page load
// (measured) while the panel stayed invisible. Now nothing Twitch-related loads until
// there is a live broadcast.
//
// The player is still watched once mounted: OFFLINE/ENDED hides the panel, which covers
// the stream ending mid-session and the ~3 min worst-case staleness of the served feed
// (2 min cron + 60s edge cache). An offline-at-load channel fires READY -> ENDED with no
// OFFLINE, so the initial state is read synchronously with getEnded() on READY.
//
// Crucially, that verdict is REMEMBERED (see `dead`). It previously was not, so a feed
// naming an offline channel re-booted a full player every 60 seconds indefinitely.
