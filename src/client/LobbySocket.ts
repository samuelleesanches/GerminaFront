   * Find a server, pick one of its workers, and connect.

   * The lobby list needs a server: ask the API (multi-server v2), falling
   * back to the page's own values. It answers "outdated" when no server
   * takes new games from this build any more, a newer version exists, and
   * this page names no server of its own — the rollover has moved on
   * without a tab whose reload really does fetch `latest`. The lobby list
   * is the first thing every homepage starts, so this is where that player
   * finds out: the same one-shot "update available" prompt a newer commit
   * in the feed raises.
   *
   * A page a game server rendered is never told that (OPE-430: its own
   * server is serving it, so a reload would come back identical and prompt
   * forever). It learns from the feed this socket is about to open —
   * checkServerCommit and checkDeploymentActive below — and, if the socket
   * never opens at all, from promptIfOutdated.
   *
   * The connection goes ahead either way, so a shell that never prompts
   * (desktop, whose updater owns updates) still gets its lobby list from
   * the fallback values.
   *
   * Retried through here rather than through connectWebSocket when no
   * server was known: the list may arrive between attempts, and until it
   * does there is no worker path to build a URL with, so a plain reconnect
   * would burn every remaining attempt on the same empty path. The attempt
   * counter is deliberately NOT reset (start() owns that), so the retries
   * still give up after maxWsAttempts.
