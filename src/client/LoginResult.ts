/**
 * One-shot login outcomes the auth callbacks hand back on the URL they
 * redirect to, as `#login=<result>`.
 *
 * `email_exists` means the sign-in was rejected because the provider's
 * verified email already belongs to an account: we never auto-merge by email,
 * so the user has to sign into the account they have and link this provider
 * from settings.
 *
 * `deleted` means the account has a queued self-service deletion. To the player
 * it reads as already deleted, so saying nothing would look like the sign-in
 * silently failed.
 *
 * `no_account` means the sign-in verified, but no OpenFront account uses that
 * identity. Web "Sign in with Steam" deliberately never creates one, so this is
 * an ordinary outcome rather than a failure, and its message has to tell the
 * player the two routes that do work.
 *
 * `error` means the provider's response could not be verified — the Steam
 * OpenID callback's refusal, and any future provider's. Deliberately says no
 * more than that: the callback cannot explain why without leaking whether a
 * given account exists.
 *
 * `cancel` is also sent (the user backed out at the provider) but needs no
 * feedback, so it is deliberately not a recognised result here.
