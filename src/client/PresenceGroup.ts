// from, what may be logged of the message that carried it, how often it is
// worth telling the shell, and how it joins a presence payload.
//
// They live here rather than inline in ClientGameRunner and Main because both
// are unreachable from a test — one drags in WebGL, the other the whole boot
// sequence — and these are precisely the parts that must not drift: a token
// picked up from only one of its two carrier messages silently leaves late
// joiners out of the group, one merged in unconditionally would publish
// `groupToken: undefined` for every singleplayer game, and a strip that only
// exists as a line inside a console.log call is a strip nothing defends.

// from the same frame, so the extra emit would publish the previous tick's
// roster. Only a genuine change is worth telling the shell about.
//

// match is an invitation to team, so neither the button nor Steam's native
// join may offer it. Public team lobbies and private lobbies stay joinable.
//
// A config not yet known also counts as not joinable, rather than joinable
// until proven otherwise: the joins that start without one (a /game/<id>
// link, an accepted Steam invite) get the real config from the next
// lobby_info moments later, so the cautious default costs a beat of shadow-
// lobby setup — the optimistic one would advertise a public FFA join for
