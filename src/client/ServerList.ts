// Multi-server v2 (docs/MultiServer.md, "Server list v2"): the API says which
// servers are running, on which commit, and whether they take new games.
//
// The list is fetched once at page load (bounded, so offline singleplayer
// waits seconds at worst and never hangs) and kept warm by a heartbeat:
// every REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS on success, and on a backing-off schedule after
// a failure (retryDelayMs).
// Clicking Join or Create therefore never waits on the network — whatever
// the list's age, ensureServerList() answers from the cached copy and
// revalidates behind it. Only a page that has never seen a list waits for a
// fetch. A refresh that fails keeps the last good list rather than throwing
// it away: the API caches its answer for seconds anyway, so a blip must not
// flip a working page into fallback.
//
// Whatever it learns is handed to ClientEnv, whose synchronous accessors
// every socket and URL builder already reads; when the list is missing or
// was never reachable ClientEnv keeps answering from BOOTSTRAP_CONFIG, so
// the client behaves exactly as it does today until the API serves a list.
//
// The heartbeat doubles as the client's backend-reachability probe
// (backendReachable() for the raw per-attempt answer,
// backendUnreachableConfirmed() for the debounced one the UI gates on, and
// the "backend-reachability" document event carrying both), and it says when
// it is busy (attemptInFlight() plus the "server-list-attempt" event), which
// is what the desktop status bar's Retry button disables itself on.

// as unanswered (fetchServerList).
//
// The point of the backoff is the long tail. A player who closes their laptop
// lid, or sits on a train through a tunnel, should not have the page firing a
// 4s request every 10s for an hour; a backend that is genuinely down should
// not take that traffic from every open tab either. The base is short because

 * On dev (`openfront.dev`, a blue/green pair behind the apex, then still

 * same build while the apex poll had green considering itself draining: a
 * page rendered by blue that drew green got a lobby feed reporting
 * `active: false`, read it as "a new version is available", and reloaded —
 * on about half of page loads. Prod would do the same across the v34

 * disagree with itself.
 *
 * Null on a page that names no server (the static Worker's — there is no own
 * server to prefer), when the list does not carry that server, or when the
 * entry it carries does not serve this build (fenced, or another version).
 * Those fall through to the ordinary sticky random pick, and the fenced and
 * lagging-registry cases through it to "fallback", exactly as before.
 *
 * The desktop shell carries an injected `serverHost` too, but its value is a
 * SITE (openfront.io, main.openfront.dev) rather than a deployment the
 * registry lists, so it names no entry and the list's pick stands — except
 * on a standalone deployment whose one server IS that host, where the two
 * answers are the same server anyway.
 *
 * Not sticky, and it does not need to be: it answers the same letter on
 * every refresh for as long as the list keeps naming the page's own server,
 * and the letter it names cannot move to another host — letters are

 * comes back identical. Here that server has stopped answering at all,
 * which is the one shape where a reload can land the player somewhere
 * better: a tab that was sitting on the homepage when its deployment was

 * - the list has no server for this build (`listStatus` is not "api"). A
 *   picked server still takes this build's games, so a socket failing
 *   against it is a network blip; and being behind `latest` is the normal
 *   state of every tab for the length of a rollout, so prompting on "api"
 *   would turn every hiccup in that window into a forced reload.
 * - there IS a newer build (behindLatest, shell exemptions included) —
 *   otherwise a reload fetches what this page already runs.
 * - a reload can land somewhere other than the page's own server
 *   (reloadCanLandElsewhere) — otherwise the prompt either fails with that
 *   server or loops against it.
 *
 * Nothing is probed. A browser cannot establish liveness: an opaque
 * cross-origin response carries no status, so a proxy answering 521 for a
 * torn-down origin and a healthy server look the same. The rule is about
 * topology instead, which the page knows for certain.
