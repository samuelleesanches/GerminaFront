// 90s via setInterval — which is two requests for the same answer. Worse, Streaming Now
// only cleared its interval in disconnectedCallback, and <play-page> is never
// disconnected (Navigation.ts toggles a `hidden` class and removes nothing), so it kept
// polling for the entire session, including all the way through a game.
//
// This module is the single fetch, and it stops: nothing is polled while a game is
// running, while the tab is hidden, or while no component wants the data. There is no
// per-component timer left to leak.
