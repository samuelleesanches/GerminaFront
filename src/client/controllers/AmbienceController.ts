 * Ceiling of the zoom envelope: what the deepest zoom multiplies the ambience

 * The sound designer's spec is "-20 dB", which is a statement about where
 * ambience sits in the MIX -- under the cues, not under itself. This used to
 * be 0.1, the literal -20 dB, applied as a raw multiplier on top of a channel
 * that is already well down: perceptualGain squares the slider, so ambience at
 * its 0.4 default is 0.16, or -16 dB, before the envelope is applied at all.
 * The two stacked, and ambience peaked at 0.016 -- -36 dBFS, 30 dB under the
 * effects channel, which is inaudible under gameplay rather than quiet. That
 * is the "ambience never plays" report: it was playing.
 *
 * Staged against the effects channel instead, which is what the cues the spec
 * is relative to actually run at:
 *
 *     effects at its 0.7 default   0.7^2        = 0.49    (-6.2 dB)
 *     spec: 20 dB under that       0.49 * 0.1   = 0.049   (-26.2 dB)
 *     ambience at its 0.4 default  0.4^2        = 0.16
 *     so the envelope needs        0.049 / 0.16 = 0.3
 *
 * Master scales both channels equally, so the 20 dB relationship holds
 * wherever the player puts it. A player who pushes the ambience slider to 1.0
 * tops out at 0.3, -10.5 dB, which is as loud as background texture should
 * ever get.
