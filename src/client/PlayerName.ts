// an account username is ASCII word characters with single interior spaces
// (AccountUsernameSchema), because the dot separates a base from its
// discriminator and two bases must never render alike. So "Zoë" and
// "Ada.Lovelace" are perfectly good in-game names and are not account names;
// prefilling the claim form with either would seed a draft that the very form
// showing it rejects on save.
//
// Accents are FOLDED, not dropped. "Müller" is a Latin name written in a
// charset this form does not take, and spacing the diacritic out gives
// "M ller" — a mangling of the player's own name, offered back to them as a
// suggestion. NFKD splits each accented letter into its base plus a combining
// mark and the marks are stripped, so "Müller" gives "Muller" and "Zoë" gives
// "Zoe". A stroked or ligature letter has no decomposition to strip — NFKD
// leaves "Ł", "Ø", "æ" and "ß" exactly as they were — so those are folded
// from the table below instead, which is why "Łukasz" gives "Lukasz" rather
// than "ukasz".
//
// The table runs AFTER the decomposition, not before, so it also catches
// letters that only become foldable once NFKD has been applied: "Ǽ" arrives
// there as "Æ" and leaves as "AE".
//
// What remains disallowed after that becomes a space, same as sanitizePersona
// and for the same reason: throwing a decorated persona away wholesale is what
// sent Steam buyers to Anon… names in the first place, and a decorative
// separator divides words rather than joining them ("Ada.Lovelace" and
// "Ada🔥Lovelace" both give "Ada Lovelace").
//

// place the result straight into the field. Anything else is null — an empty

// rather than a combining character: strokes, bars and ligatures. Confined to
