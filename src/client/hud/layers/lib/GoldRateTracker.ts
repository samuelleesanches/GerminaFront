/**
 * Tracks per-player gold (and gold-source) values over a rolling window of
 * in-game time and computes per-minute rates.  Used by the leaderboard
 * "Gold Income/min", "Ship Trade Gold/min", "Train Trade Gold/min" and
 * "Piracy Gold/min" columns.
 *
 * Time is measured in game ticks (the sim clock, 10 ticks/second), NOT wall
 * time — when the in-game timer stops (pause / frozen sim) the rates read 0
 * instead of silently decaying. The window spans 2 in-game minutes to smooth
 * lumpy events (ship arrivals); because the tracked values are cumulative,
 * the two-point slope over the window IS the moving average of the per-interval
 * rates (consecutive deltas telescope). Call {@link record} once per player
 * per refresh with the current values and tick, then read back the smoothed
 * rate via {@link goldIncomePerMin}, {@link shipTradeGoldPerMin},
 * {@link trainTradeGoldPerMin} or {@link piracyGoldPerMin}.
