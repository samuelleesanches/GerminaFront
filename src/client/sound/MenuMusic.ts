 * Where the ramp starts, in dB below its target.
 *
 * This is driven here rather than through Howler's fade() because fade() is
 * linear in AMPLITUDE, and loudness is roughly linear in dB -- so a linear
 * ramp is heavily front-loaded and does not sound like a fade at all. At the
 * real defaults (music slider 0.5, squared by perceptualGain, times the -1 dB
 * trim, so a target of 0.2225) Howler's 0.01 quantisation gives 22 steps, and
 * the first two of them cover the bottom 21 dB:
 *
 *     90ms  0.01  -26.9 dB      989ms  0.11   -6.1 dB
 *    180ms  0.02  -20.9 dB     1438ms  0.16   -2.9 dB
 *    449ms  0.05  -13.0 dB     1978ms  0.22   -0.1 dB
 *
 * Within 6 dB of final at one second and 3 dB at 1.4s: the last 600ms are
 * inaudible and the track has perceptually arrived in about 300ms. Stepping
 * linearly in dB instead spends equal time on equal perceived change.
 *
 * -48 dB is low enough to start from true silence to the ear without wasting
 * the front of the ramp somewhere nothing is audible.

/**
 * Loops the menu theme on the home page. Browsers block audio until a user
 * gesture, so the Howl is created and started inside the first
 * pointerdown/keydown. It fades out for good when a game starts
 * ("game-starting", like JoinLobbyModal's chime).
 *
 * It then re-arms on "menu-restored". "game-starting" fires at lobby PRESTART
 * (Main.ts, inside lobbyHandle.prestart.then), and a player who leaves in the
 * window between that and the game actually starting gets the home page put
 * back in place rather than reloaded (handleLeaveLobby, OPE-255). Tearing the
 * gesture listeners down for good would leave that live home page silent for
 * the rest of the session. Re-arming rather than replaying is deliberate: the
 * autoplay rule applies just as much to the second start as the first.
 *
 * Every start ramps up from silence rather than arriving at full level, in
 * even dB steps rather than Howler's linear-amplitude fade(). The ramp reads
 * the music channel on every step, so the slider and the focus duck both
 * reach the theme while it is still coming up; the Howl is handed to the
 * mixer when the ramp lands, which is the only place it is registered.
 *
 * The 700ms fade-OUT is left on Howler's own fade(): it is short, it happens
 * under a scene change, and a linear fade-out errs by dropping away late
 * rather than by arriving instantly, which is far less noticeable than the
 * same curve going the other way.
