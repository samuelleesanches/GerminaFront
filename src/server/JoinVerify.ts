 * Pure decision for whether a join needs a join_verify call, kept free of

 * SECURITY: the API skips siteverify entirely when the token is null,
 * trusting the game server to only do that for already-admitted reconnects
 * (whose single-use token is spent). A first join must therefore present a
 * token — rejecting instead of forwarding a null one, which would be a full
 * Turnstile bypass.
 *
 * Re-admits verify with a null token (name check alone), and only when the
 * verdict could matter: identity updates apply only before the game starts,
 * and an unchanged identity was already screened when it was admitted. The
 * skips keep mass reconnects at game start off the API.
 *
 * Exception: a Steam-authenticated first join (`steamAuthed`, see
 * isSteamAuthenticated) also verifies with a null token instead of
 * rejecting for a missing Turnstile token — Steam ownership is the
 * anti-abuse signal in that case, and the join still runs the name check.

/**
 * Verify a joining player against the API's join_verify endpoint, which runs
 * the Turnstile check and name censoring concurrently: `status` is the
 * Turnstile verdict, and on approval the (username, clanTag) pair is the
 * display-ready identity for the session — a banned username as its
 * deterministic shadow name, a banned tag as null, a surviving tag
 * uppercased.
 *
 * SECURITY: a null token SKIPS siteverify — the API trusts the game server
 * to omit the token only for already-admitted reconnects (whose single-use
 * token is spent); those come back approved with just the name check run.
 * Callers must never forward a first join with a null token (see
 * planJoinVerify).
 *
 * Failures are never retried: a Turnstile token is single-use, so
 * re-submitting after a timeout or 5xx can redeem an already-spent token and
 * turn an API hiccup into a hard rejection of a legitimate player. Any
 * failure returns "error" and the caller fails open with the locally
 * screened name (see Censor.ts), matching the old standalone-Turnstile
 * stance.
