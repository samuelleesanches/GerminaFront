// match; the API hands back an assignment and the worker creates the game.

// not: on 15 Sept 2026 blue was `draining` with v0.34.0 while every
// openfront.io page served green's v0.34.1, and blue's workers kept checking
// in. Players on the new build were matched into blue's games, were answered
// `version_mismatch`, navigated to blue's page to get the matching build, and
// arrived after the start deadline — so the match cancelled short-handed
// ("cancelling matchmade game, missing players at deadline" across blue's
// logs) and the game was pruned before they could connect.
//
// Games already assigned or running are untouched by this: the gate only
// decides whether to make a NEW offer.

 * flips underneath us: the master reconciles BOTH drain sources — the
 * registry's check-in answer (`open` vs `draining`/`fenced`) and the apex
 * colour poll — into one boolean and pushes it to the workers, so the worker
 * only has to obey whatever it last heard.
 *
 * The default before the first master broadcast is active (see
 * `WorkerLobbyService.deploymentActive`), which is exactly the pre-OPE-469
 * behaviour: a worker that never hears from its master keeps taking matches
 * rather than silently refusing to host any.
 *
 * One gate is shared by every mode's loop so a drain logs once, not once per
 * queue.
