// deriveServerWsBase resolves the game-server WebSocket origin used by both the
// public-lobby socket (LobbySocket) and the in-game socket (Transport).
//
// The web build injects no serverHost, so it must keep the historical
// same-origin behaviour (derive scheme + host from window.location). The
// desktop app loads from app://openfront — where location.host is not a real
// server — and injects an EXPLICIT game-server host (the host is branch-variable
// on dev and not derivable from the API audience), which is targeted over TLS.
