/**
 * Gold-per-minute benchmark of a full nation game.
 *
 * Spawns every nation from the world map manifest at Impossible difficulty
 * with the real production Config (real attack logic, nukes, trade routing —
 * not the TestConfig stubs) and lets the real NationExecutions play the game:
 * expanding, warring, and building their own ports, factories and cities.
 * Nothing is scripted; every port and train line exists because a nation
 * decided to build it.
 *
 * Each game minute (600 ticks) the test samples the gold earned from trade
 * ships and trains across all nations and pins the per-minute table in a
 * snapshot. When the economy meta changes (tradeShipGold, trainGold, spawn
 * rates, structure costs…), the snapshot diff shows exactly how gold per
 * minute shifts over the course of a real game — including second-order
 * effects like nations affording more ports earlier. A pure refactor must
 * leave the snapshot untouched. See TradeTrainGolden.test.ts for the raw
 * formulas and TradeTrainScenarios.test.ts for isolated route benchmarks.
 *
 * StatsImpl ignores nations (they have no clientID), so gold is tallied by
 * wrapping the Stats hooks the sim calls on every payout. All randomness is
 * PseudoRandom seeded from the fixed game ID and nation names, so runs are
 * deterministic.
