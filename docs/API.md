# API Usage

## Games

### List Game Metadata

Get game IDs and basic metadata for games that started within a specified time range. Results are sorted by start time and paginated.

**Constraints:**

- Maximum time range: 2 days
- Maximum limit per request: 1000 games

**Endpoint:**

```
GET https://api.openfront.io/public/games
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `start` (required): ISO 8601 timestamp
- `end` (required): ISO 8601 timestamp
- `type` (optional): Game type, must be one of `[Private, Public, Singleplayer]`
- `mode` (optional): Game mode, must be one of `[Free For All, Team]`
- `rankedType` (optional): Ranked type, must be one of `[unranked, 1v1, 2v2]`
- `playerTeams` (optional): Player team configuration (e.g. `Duos`)
- `limit` (optional): Number of results (max 1000, default 50)
- `offset` (optional): Pagination offset

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl "https://api.openfront.io/public/games?start=2025-10-25T00:00:00Z&end=2025-10-26T23:59:59Z&type=Public&mode=Team&rankedType=unranked&limit=10&offset=5"
```

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "game": "ABSgwin6",
    "start": "2025-10-25T00:00:10.526Z",
    "end": "2025-10-25T00:19:45.187Z",
    "type": "Public",
    "mode": "Team",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "numPlayers": 6,
    "maxPlayers": 8,
    "lobbyFillTime": 45000,
    "playerTeams": "Duos",
    "rankedType": "unranked"
  }
]
```

The response includes a `Content-Range` header indicating pagination (e.g., `games 5-15/399`).

### Get Game Info

Retrieve detailed information about a specific game.

**Endpoint:**

```
GET https://api.openfront.io/public/game/:gameId
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `turns` (optional): Set to `false` to exclude turn data and reduce response size

**Examples:**

```bash
# Full game data
curl "https://api.openfront.io/public/game/ABSgwin6"

# Without turn data
curl "https://api.openfront.io/public/game/ABSgwin6?turns=false"
```

**Note:** Public player IDs are stripped from game records for privacy.

## Players

### Get Player Info

Retrieve information and stats for a specific player.

**Endpoint:**

```
GET https://api.openfront.io/public/player/:playerId
```

**Example:**

```bash
curl "https://api.openfront.io/public/player/HabCsQYR"
```

### Get Player Sessions

Retrieve a list of games & client ids (session ids) for a specific player,
returned newest game first in pages of 100 with keyset (cursor) pagination
like [Get Player Games](#get-player-games).

**Endpoint:**

```
GET https://api.openfront.io/public/player/:playerId/sessions
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `filter` (optional): Mode bucket, one of `[ffa, team, hvn, ranked]`. Omit for all modes.
- `type` (optional): Game type, one of `[public, private, singleplayer]`. Omit for all types. `filter` and `type` are orthogonal and may be combined.
- `start` / `end` (optional): ISO 8601 datetimes bounding the game start time (inclusive). Each may be given alone; `start` must be before `end`.
- `cursor` (optional): Opaque continuation token. Pass the `nextCursor` value from the previous response verbatim to fetch the next page — do not construct or parse it. A cursor is bound to the filters it was issued under; changing any other parameter requires starting over without a cursor.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "gameId": "abc123",
      "gameStart": "2026-05-17T21:04:00.000Z",
      "gameEnd": "2026-05-17T21:24:34.000Z",
      "gameType": "Public",
      "gameMode": "Team",
      "gameRankedType": "unranked",
      "clientId": "client-session-id",
      "username": "alice",
      "clanTag": "ABC",
      "hasWon": true
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": "opaque-token"
}
```

- `nextCursor` is `null` when there are no more sessions.
- A known player with no sessions returns an empty `results` array; 404 means
  the player id is unknown.

**Example:**

```bash
curl "https://api.openfront.io/public/player/HabCsQYR/sessions"
```

### Get Player Games

Retrieve a player's personal game history, newest first. Uses keyset (cursor)
pagination rather than the `page`/`limit` scheme used elsewhere.

**Endpoint:**

```
GET https://api.openfront.io/public/player/:playerId/games
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `filter` (optional): Mode bucket, one of `[ffa, team, hvn, ranked]`. Omit for all modes.
- `type` (optional): Game type, one of `[public, private, singleplayer]`. Omit for all types. `filter` and `type` are orthogonal and may be combined.
- `cursor` (optional): Opaque continuation token. Pass the `nextCursor` value from the previous response verbatim to fetch the next page — do not construct or parse it.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "gameId": "abc123",
      "start": "2026-05-17T21:04:00.000Z",
      "durationSeconds": 1234,
      "map": "World",
      "mode": "Team",
      "type": "Public",
      "playerTeams": "Duos",
      "rankedType": "unranked",
      "result": "victory",
      "totalPlayers": 8,
      "username": "alice",
      "clanTag": "ABC"
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": "opaque-token"
}
```

- `result` is one of `[victory, defeat, incomplete]` (`incomplete` = no recorded winner).
- `playerTeams`, `totalPlayers`, and `clanTag` may be `null`.
- `nextCursor` is `null` when there are no more games.
- `username`/`clanTag` reflect the identity the player used in that specific game.

**Example:**

```bash
curl "https://api.openfront.io/public/player/HabCsQYR/games?filter=team&type=public"
```

### Recently Deleted Players

List the public ids of players deleted in the last 7 days, newest first. Poll
this daily and delete those players from any data you have collected.

Pass `since` (the `deletedAt` of your last sync, or the time you last polled)
to fetch only newer deletions. Deletions are never returned more than 7 days
after the fact: a `since` more than 7 days in the past is rejected with a 400.
If you miss the window, reconcile instead by dropping any player whose
`/public/player/:playerId` now returns 404.

**Endpoint:**

```
GET https://api.openfront.io/public/players/recently-deleted
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `since` (optional): ISO 8601 timestamp; only return players deleted after
  this time. Must be within the last 7 days.

**Example:**

```bash
curl "https://api.openfront.io/public/players/recently-deleted?since=2026-09-14T00:00:00Z"
```

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "publicId": "HabCsQYR",
    "deletedAt": "2026-09-14T08:12:33.000Z"
  }
]
```

### Verify Account Ownership (Identity Tokens)

Third-party sites can let a player prove which OpenFront account they own. The
player picks your site under **Account settings → Link to a third-party site**,
generates a token, and pastes it into your site. You check the token, link the
returned `publicId` to your user once, and discard the token.

Tokens are only accepted by the site they were generated for (the JWT `aud`
claim is your domain), expire after 10 minutes, and carry no identity other
than the player's public ID. They cannot be used to log in to OpenFront.

Supported sites: `ofstats.io`, `trackerfront.io`. To add your site, ask the
OpenFront team. Sites are managed from the admin panel, so no deploy is
needed; a new site appears in the game within a few minutes.

You can check a token in either of two ways.

**Option 1: call the validate endpoint.**

```
POST https://api.openfront.io/public/identity_token/validate
```

**Body:**

- `token`: The token the player pasted
- `audience`: Your site, e.g. `ofstats.io`

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.openfront.io/public/identity_token/validate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token": "eyJ...", "audience": "ofstats.io"}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "publicId": "T8pcWNuC",
  "expiresAt": "2026-09-25T03:36:56.000Z"
}
```

A token that is invalid, expired, or was generated for a different site returns 400.

**Option 2: verify the JWT yourself.** Tokens are EdDSA-signed JWTs. Verify the
signature against `https://api.openfront.io/.well-known/jwks.json` and check
that:

- `iss` is `https://api.openfront.io`
- `aud` is your own domain
- `typ` is `"identity"`
- `exp` has not passed

The player's public ID is the `sub` claim.

**Example payload:**

```json
{
  "typ": "identity",
  "sub": "T8pcWNuC",
  "iat": 1790306816,
  "exp": 1790307416,
  "iss": "https://api.openfront.io",
  "aud": "ofstats.io"
}
```

## Clans

### Clan Leaderboard

Shows the top 100 clans by `weighted wins`.

**Endpoint:**

```
GET https://api.openfront.io/public/clans/leaderboard
```

Weighted wins have a half-life of 30 days to favor recent wins.

Weighted wins are calculated using the following formula:

```
FUNCTION calculateScore(session: ClanSession, decay: NUMBER = 1) → NUMBER
    // 1. Calculate average team size
    avgTeamSize ← session.totalPlayerCount ÷ session.numTeams

    // 2. Determine how much the clan contributed to their team
    //    (clan players divided by average players per team)
    clanMemberRatio ← session.clanPlayerCount ÷ avgTeamSize

    // 3. Apply decay factor (e.g., for older sessions)
    weightedValue ← clanMemberRatio × decay

    // 4. Calculate match difficulty based on number of teams
    //    More teams → harder to win → higher reward for victory
    //    Uses square root to avoid extreme scaling
    difficulty ← MAX(1, √(session.numTeams - 1))

    // 5. Return final score:
    //    - Win:  reward is multiplied by difficulty
    //    - Loss: penalty is divided by difficulty (less punishment in harder matches)
    IF session.hasWon THEN
        RETURN weightedValue × difficulty
    ELSE
        RETURN weightedValue ÷ difficulty
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Clan stats

Displays comprehensive clan performance statistics for a specified clan over a chosen time range. If no time range is provided, it shows lifetime stats (starting from early November 2025).

Key metrics include:

- Total games, wins, losses, and win rate
- Win/loss ratio and weighted win/loss ratio\* broken down by:
  - Team type (e.g., 2 teams, 3 teams, duos, trios, etc)
  - Number of teams in the game (2 teams, 5 teams, 20 teams, etc)

**Note:** No decay is used, so weighted wins will be different from in the leaderboard.

**Endpoint**

```
GET https://openfront.io/public/clan/:clanTag
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `start` (optional): ISO 8601 timestamp
- `end` (optional): ISO 8601 timestamp

**Example**

```bash
curl https://api.openfront.io/public/clan/UN?start=2025-11-15T00:00:00Z &
end=2025-11-18T23:59:59Z
```

### Clan Sessions

A clan session is created any time a player with that clan tag is in a public team game. If no start or end query parameter is provided, lifetime sessions (starting early November 2025) are shown.

**Endpoint**

```
GET https://api.openfront.io/public/clan/:clanTag/sessions
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `start` (optional): ISO 8601 timestamp
- `end` (optional): ISO 8601 timestamp
- `page` (optional): Page number, 1-200 (default: 1)
- `limit` (optional): Results per page, 1-50 (default: 20)

**Response:**

```json
{
  "results": [ ... ],
  "total": 150,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 20
}
```

Results are ordered by game start time, newest first.

**Example**

```bash
curl "https://api.openfront.io/public/clan/UN/sessions?start=2025-11-15T00:00:00Z&end=2025-11-18T23:59:59Z&limit=10&page=1"
```
