# Multi-Server Architecture — Implementation Plan

Status: planned. Design summary and decisions below; the meat of this document
is the PR list.

One machine handles current load; this design is the contingency for a viral
Steam launch. Most of its pieces fix live bugs on one machine today, so they
land early as production no-ops: on the current single box every PR below runs
with a two-entry cluster map (blue + green on falk2) and changes no observable
behavior except the bugs it fixes.

## Design summary

- **No coordinator.** Servers are independent. Each keeps its own master, its
  own lobby roster, and schedules its own public lobbies. Public lobbies are
  split per server deliberately (partitions the join rate); private lobbies
  work across servers via the game-ID link.
- **One global pool, no regions.** Demand is diurnally correlated; latency is
  fine for a lockstep RTS behind Argo.
- **Topology is config.** `cluster.json` maps an instance letter to
  `{ host, color, numWorkers }`. Adding a machine = DNS + pool origins + one
  config entry + fleet redeploy.
- **Game IDs route themselves.** Char 0 of a game ID is the minting server's
  instance letter; the rest is random. Any client can resolve any game ID to a
  host + worker path from the cluster map alone — zero extra requests.
- **The full-page redirect is the universal fallback.** The target's own page
  always serves its own build and its own config, so any misroute
  self-corrects.
- **Cloudflare:** two LB pools, blue and green, each containing every server
  as an origin (color Host header, e.g. `falk2-blue.openfront.io`; Traefik
  routes by Host). Promotion = reorder pools + purge, regardless of fleet
  size. Color subdomains are plain proxied DNS records; the LB only matters
  for fresh page loads — after that the page is pinned via `serverHost`.
- **Not doing:** coordinator DO / shared roster, geo steering, L7 game proxy,
  relay-in-DO, autoscaling.

## Decisions (settled 2026-09-08)

| Question                                                    | Decision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Relationship to open PR #5164                               | **Absorb it.** Fold `t3code/preserve-websocket-old-deployment` (ActiveDeployment, serverHost pinning, drain, version-mismatch join gate) into this work as PR 2 and supersede that PR.                                                                                                                                |
| New game ID size                                            | **10 chars total** — instance letter + 9 random from the existing 58-symbol alphabet. `GAME_ID_REGEX` widens to a `{8,10}` length range so archived 8-char IDs stay valid. (~0.8 expected archive-key collisions at 200M lifetime games; today's 8-char IDs are already near their first expected collision at ~20M.) |
| Deployment color source                                     | **Explicit `color` field in cluster.json** — read by boot validation, `/api/health`, and the drain check. Subdomain naming is not load-bearing.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Matchmaking DO re-key (`mode` instead of `instanceId:mode`) | **API-side only.** This repo keeps sending `instance_id` (client join param, worker checkin body); the API just stops keying on it. Zero-coordination rollout. Since infra #738 the key is `site:mode` — see "The ranked queue is keyed by site" below.                                                               |

## Server identity (formerly `cluster.json`)

A server knows only itself, from four env vars. Where it answers
(`GAME_HOST`, `SITE_HOST`) is settled by `deploy.sh` from the deploy target;
who it is (`INSTANCE_LETTER`, `NUM_WORKERS`) is the API registry's answer.
`update.sh` asks once per deploy, on the box, before anything is rendered or
swapped (`POST /cluster/register` with `{site, host, cpus}`; infra
`docs/cluster-registry.md`, "Registration") and writes the reply into the
container's env file.

| Env               | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INSTANCE_LETTER` | Leads every game id it mints. The registry hands a host the letter already bound to it, or the site's lowest unused one; bindings are permanent and letters are never reused.                                                                             |
| `NUM_WORKERS`     | Worker processes. The operator's setting for that letter in the admin panel's Cluster page, else the API's default for the machine's thread count. Fixed for the container's life (ids route by `hash % NUM_WORKERS`): a change lands on the next deploy. |
| `GAME_HOST`       | The name clients open sockets to. Defaults to `<subdomain>.<game domain>`; a machine-scoped fleet member (`blue.nbg2.<game domain>`) passes it. Also decides the container name (update.sh).                                                              |
| `SITE_HOST`       | The page host. Passed explicitly it wins (a target entry's optional `site`); else the apex (`DOMAIN`) for the `blue` and `green` slots, which belong to the apex site by convention; else `<subdomain>.<DOMAIN>` under `GAME_DOMAIN`; else empty.         |

A deploy that cannot reach the registry fails before the old container is
touched. `INSTANCE_LETTER` and `NUM_WORKERS` set in `deploy.sh`'s own
environment are passed through and win over the registry, for a hand-run
deploy while the API is down. Local development registers nowhere and defaults
to `a` and 2.

The deploy targets (`DEPLOY_TARGETS_BLUE`, `DEPLOY_TARGETS_GREEN`,
`DEPLOY_TARGETS_BETA` for the release, `DEPLOY_TARGETS_DEV` for the nightly)
only say where containers run:

```json
[
  { "host": "falk2", "subdomain": "blue" },
  { "host": "nbg2", "subdomain": "blue", "gameHost": "blue.nbg2.openfront.io" }
]
```

There is no shared map any more. The fleet as a whole is the API registry's
list (`GET /cluster.json?site=…`, "The server list" below), assembled from
the check-ins; the server still synthesizes a one-entry map naming itself
(`ServerEnv.cluster()`) for the page it renders, which is the page's
fallback when the list is unavailable. The game server serves no
`/cluster.json` of its own. Which server takes new games is the registry's decision alone
(`latest` plus one open server per machine), so `color` is gone with the map:
blue and green are deploy slots, nothing more.

## Routing rule (uniform — own deployment is not a special case)

```
sub, N = cluster[id[0]]
open ws to sub, path /w{hash(id) % N}
  accepted          → play                      (common case, zero extra requests)
  version_mismatch  → full page redirect to sub (their shell = their build = lockstep-safe)
  unknown letter    → redirect to apex          (freshest map re-resolves)
```

The `version_mismatch` payload carries the server's commit so the client can
tell "I'm stale, reload" from "that game is on another build, redirect".

### Why the deployment is a letter but the worker is a hash

Hash-routing is only sound where the modulus is frozen for the lifetime of
everything minted under it. A letter's worker count has exactly that
lifecycle: its color drains on every promotion, so the rule "change a
letter's `numWorkers` only on a deploy after its color has fully drained"
comes free with the blue/green cadence. Routing only matters while a game is
alive (archived IDs resolve via the API, not workers), so a drained color's
count is safe to change.

The fleet has no such freeze. A fleet redeploy synchronizes the _servers_
onto a new map, but not the two things that actually hold routing state:
live games straddle the flip on the draining color for hours, and open
tabs / desktop apps keep their map for their own lifetime — there is always
a mixed-map population. Under `hash(id) % numDeployments`, adding a machine
re-routes existing live games' IDs (shared lobby links and rejoins break at
every fleet change), and removal is worse: shrink N and everything
reshuffles, or keep N and 1/(old N) of the keyspace — including new mints —
points at a dead server forever, compounding with every retirement. Both
failures are silent: every ID hashes to _somewhere_, and a misroute answers
"game not found" on a healthy server.

The letter is the minimum stable token that lets an ID survive map changes:
resolution is append-only (a letter never re-resolves; a removed one goes
_unknown_, which is loud and falls back to the apex), mixed maps are safe in
both directions, retirement is just drain-then-delete, and any ID names its
server on sight. It costs one character; any scheme that patches the hash's
instability (epoch markers, bucket maps) ends up re-inventing it.

## PR list

Dependency graph (PRs 1–3 are independent of each other):

```
PR 1 (ID widening, soak) ─────────────┐
PR 2 (absorb #5164) ──┬── PR 4 (cluster.json) ──┬── PR 5 (client routing)
PR 3 (loud close)     └────────────── PR 6 (color drain)
                                       API-side: matchmaking re-key (after PR 5 is broadly deployed)
```

### PR 1 — Widen game-ID validation to `{8,10}` (land early, soak)

The regex change must be on effectively every client before anything mints a
10-char ID, so this ships first and soaks. Minting stays at 8 chars until
PR 4.

- `src/core/Schemas.ts`: `GAME_ID_REGEX` → `/^[A-Za-z0-9]{8,10}$/`. `ID` and
  the zbin `MappedID` follow the constant automatically; zbin strings are
  varint-length + UTF-8, so the wire layout is unchanged — the soak is purely
  about old bundles' Zod validation rejecting longer IDs.
- Audit the regex's consumers for anything length-sensitive beyond the
  constant: `JoinLobbyModal` (paste/normalize flow), `Main.ts` URL parsing,
  `GamePreviewRoute`.
- Client IDs validate against the same regex (`CLIENT_ID_MAPPING`) but stay
  8 chars generated; the range covers them.
- Tests (required — `src/core` change): regex accepts 8- and 10-char IDs,
  rejects 7 and 11; zbin round-trip of a 10-char mapped and inline ID.

No-op in production: nothing emits a >8-char ID yet.

**Deploy gate for later PRs:** PR 4's minting flips on only after this has
soaked — web clients are forced current by PR 2's version gate at next
deploy, but Steam/desktop builds must ship an update containing it first.

### PR 2 — Absorb #5164: pin tabs to their deployment, drain, version gate

Rebase the content of `t3code/preserve-websocket-old-deployment` onto main as
one PR and close #5164 as superseded. Fixes live bugs on one box today:
mid-game reconnects crossing a blue/green flip, drained deployments being
farmed for empty public lobbies, and stale tabs desyncing games they join.

- `src/server/ActiveDeployment.ts` (new): poll apex `/api/health` for the
  live deployment's identity; null-tolerant (a Cloudflare hiccup must never
  drain the live deployment).
- `src/server/Master.ts` + `MasterLobbyService.ts`: report `instanceId` from
  `/api/health`; stop scheduling public lobbies when inactive (queued lobbies
  still start; games keep running).
- `src/server/RenderHtml.ts` + `deploy.sh` + `release.yml`: inject
  `serverHost` (`SUBDOMAIN.DOMAIN`) into the web shell so the page talks to
  its own deployment directly, reconnects included.
- `src/core/Schemas.ts` + `src/server/Worker.ts`: `gitCommit` on
  join/rejoin; server rejects mismatched joins with a typed
  `version_mismatch` error and closes 1000. `PublicLobbyFullSchema.gitCommit`
  lets the homepage prompt a refresh after a deploy.
- **Addition over the original branch (checklist item 4, server half):** the
  `version_mismatch` error payload carries the server's commit. The client
  keeps its current reload behavior in this PR; PR 5 teaches it to
  distinguish reload from redirect. Adding the field here avoids touching
  this wire message twice.
- Tests: carried over from the branch (`ActiveDeployment`,
  `MasterLobbyServiceActive`, `RenderHtml`, `ServerEnv`,
  `ClientVersionSchemas`, `GameApiCors`) plus the commit-in-payload case.

### PR 3 — Loud close on worker-ID mismatch (live bug, independent)

Today `src/server/Worker.ts` (`expectedWorkerId !== workerId`) logs and bare-
returns, leaving the socket open — the client hangs silently.

- Close the socket with a typed error/close code (vocabulary already in
  `src/core/CloseCodes.ts`, e.g. a `WrongWorker` rejection in the 4xxx app
  range) instead of returning.
- Client-side handling stays generic in this PR (terminal close → error
  surface); PR 5 routes it into the redirect fallback.
- Tests: join aimed at the wrong worker gets a close, not a hang.

### PR 4 — cluster.json: config plumbing, delete NUM_WORKERS, letter minting

The core of the design. On today's two-entry map this is a production no-op
except for the new ID format.

- `CLUSTER_JSON` env → `ServerEnv`: Zod schema (unique letters/hosts, color
  enum), self-entry lookup by `SUBDOMAIN.DOMAIN` (bare `DOMAIN` when
  `SUBDOMAIN` is empty), refuse boot when malformed or absent.
- Delete `NUM_WORKERS` everywhere it lives:
  - `src/server/ServerEnv.ts` (`numWorkers()` reads own cluster entry),
    `src/server/Master.ts` fork loop, `MasterLobbyService` readiness.
  - `src/server/RenderHtml.ts`: inject the full cluster map + own letter into
    `BOOTSTRAP_CONFIG` (replaces `numWorkers`); `src/client/ClientEnv.ts`
    re-hydrates both.
  - `generate-nginx-upstream.sh` + `Dockerfile` `start.sh`: derive the
    in-container worker count from `CLUSTER_JSON` + `SUBDOMAIN.DOMAIN` (the
    nginx `/wN` port map is generated at container start).
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (`vars.NUM_WORKERS` → `vars.CLUSTER_JSON`),
    `deploy.sh` env file, `package.json` dev script (single-entry localhost
    map), `tests/GenerateNginxUpstream.test.ts`, `tests/server/*` env setup,
    `tests/matchmaking/e2e.mjs`.
- `GET /cluster.json` on the master (desktop server discovery). Since
  removed: the desktop shell synthesizes its own map and never fetched it.
- Minting: `generateID()` grows a variant for game IDs — own instance letter
  - 9 random chars; `generateGameIdForWorker` keeps hash-to-self rejection
    sampling over the full 10-char ID. Client IDs stay 8-char.
- Tests: config validation (dup letters/hosts, bad color, missing self),
  self-entry resolution incl. dev, minted IDs match `^<letter>[alphabet]{9}$`
  and hash to the requested worker, RenderHtml injection shape.

**Deploy gate:** prod deploy waits for PR 1 soak on desktop/Steam.

### PR 5 — Per-game routing in the client (the seam PR 2 built)

- `src/client/ClientEnv.ts` `resolveServerOrigin()` becomes per-game: letter
  → cluster entry → `{ host, numWorkers }` → `wss://host/w{hash % N}`. Both
  the WS and HTTP bases follow, so `checkActiveLobby`, game preview, and the
  join socket all route cross-server with zero extra requests. Own-server
  paths (lobby list, create_game) keep using own entry via `serverHost` —
  uniform rule, no special case.
- `version_mismatch` handling forks on the commit in the payload (PR 2):
  server commit == own → stale, reload (current behavior); different → full
  page redirect to the game's host so their shell serves their build.
- Unknown letter → redirect to apex (freshest map re-resolves); if already on
  the apex shell, fall through to not-found.
- Worker-mismatch close (PR 3) → same redirect fallback.
- Desktop: resolve the cluster map from `GET /cluster.json` on its configured
  `serverHost` at boot (replaces the baked `numWorkers: 1`); the Electron
  shell repo consumes this separately.
- Tests: origin resolution per letter, fallback paths, mismatch fork.

### PR 6 — Color-compare drain check

Fixes the false-drain PR 2's mechanism would develop with multiple active
origins behind the apex: an active server polling the apex often gets a
_sibling's_ `instanceId` and wrongly concludes it is inactive. Color is
deployment-wide; instanceId is per-machine.

- `/api/health` reports the deployment `color` (from the server's own
  cluster entry) alongside `instanceId`.
- `src/server/ActiveDeployment.ts`: compare colors, not instanceIds — "is
  the live color mine?". Null-tolerance semantics unchanged.
- Draining colors keep their games, stop scheduling public lobbies, and stay
  addressable forever via the ID letter — which is what fixes shared lobby
  links and mid-match rejoins across a cutover, on one machine or ten.
- Tests: sibling-same-color answer does not drain; other-color answer
  drains; null answers never drain.

Depends on PR 2 (ActiveDeployment exists) and PR 4 (color comes from the
cluster entry).

### API-side (closed source, not a PR here) — matchmaking DO key

Key the ranked matchmaking DO per `mode`, not `instanceId:mode` (which splits
queues across servers and abandons one queue per deploy). This repo keeps
sending `instance_id` in the client join URL and `instanceId` in the worker
checkin body; the API ignores them as a key.

**Sequencing:** only flip this after PR 5 is live on effectively all clients
— with a mode-only queue, any server's worker can claim a match, so the
assigned game ID may carry another server's letter, and pre-PR-5 clients
cannot route it.

## Rollout order

1. PR 1, PR 2, PR 3 — independent; land in any order. PR 1 as early as
   possible (soak clock starts at the first desktop/Steam release containing
   it).
2. PR 4 — after PR 2 (serverHost injection). Prod deploy gated on PR 1 soak.
3. PR 5 — after PR 4.
4. PR 6 — after PR 2 and PR 4.
5. API matchmaking re-key — after PR 5 is broadly deployed.

Adding the second machine later is not a code change: DNS records, add the
machine's blue/green origins to both CF pools, two new cluster.json entries,
fleet redeploy.

## Runbook: adding a machine (implemented by the multi-host deploy jobs)

All of these are config edits; no code changes.

1. Provision the box; install docker/traefik per the existing host setup.
2. DNS: the new machine's game hosts → the new machine. The fleet shape is
   **machine-scoped**: every box carries its own `blue` and `green`, and
   the machine sits in the hostname — `blue.nbg2.<game domain>`,
   `green.nbg2.<game domain>` — so one wildcard record
   (`*.nbg2.<game domain>`) covers the box. deploy.sh looks a deployment
   up under that name first and under the bare `<subdomain>.<game domain>`
   second, so a fleet can carry both shapes while it migrates
   (`blue2.openfront.io` still works; it is just a standalone-shaped entry
   on a second machine). A machine-scoped container is named
   `openfront-<env>-<machine>-<subdomain>`, which is what lets staging
   rehearse two machines on one box: `staging2` is a second name for the
   staging box in `SERVER_HOSTS_JSON`, and its blue and green sit next to
   staging's own as `blue.staging2.server.openfront.dev` and
   `green.staging2.server.openfront.dev`.
3. Secrets: add the machine to `SERVER_HOSTS_JSON`
   (`{"falk2":"<ip>","nbg2":"<ip>"}`, lowercase keys) — deploy.sh resolves
   machine names from this directory and keyscans only the machine it is
   deploying to. Legacy `SERVER_HOST_<NAME>` secrets remain a fallback for
   local runs, but in CI only `SERVER_HOST_FALK2` is wired through — every
   other machine must be in the directory.
4. Vars: add the machine's blue and green to the `DEPLOY_TARGETS_BLUE` and
   `DEPLOY_TARGETS_GREEN` **repository** vars with their game hosts:
   `[{"host":"falk2","subdomain":"blue"},{"host":"nbg2","subdomain":"blue","gameHost":"blue.nbg2.openfront.io"}]`
   (machine-scoped: the subdomain is the slot, the host is the machine). The
   registry assigns each new host a letter on its first deploy and sizes its
   workers from the machine; adjust the count on the admin Cluster page.
   Repository-level, not environment-level: GitHub expands a job's matrix
   before its environment exists, so an environment-scoped var would be
   invisible there and the jobs would silently deploy only the single-box
   default. The deploy jobs run one sequential matrix leg per entry and stop
   the rollout at the first failing machine.
5. Cloudflare: add the new blue/green origins to their pools.
6. Deploy.

Removal is the reverse, drain-first: drop the machine from the
`DEPLOY_TARGETS_*` vars and the CF pools, let its letters drain (flip away,
wait for games to end), then retire its letters on the admin Cluster page and
delete its `SERVER_HOSTS_JSON` entry. The letters stay retired forever.

## Future (discussed, not built)

- **Merged public lobby feeds:** built as a per-site lobby coordinator on
  the API (infra `docs/lobby-coordinator.md`) rather than the sibling poll
  first sketched here. Every master holds one WebSocket to its site's
  coordinator (`src/server/LobbyCoordinatorClient.ts`), reports its own
  lobbies, and gets back the merged roster for its build plus "create the
  next lobby" and "this lobby counts down" commands; the queue depth is
  site-wide. `MasterLobbyService` runs `coordinated` while rosters arrive
  and falls back to today's single-server scheduling within 5 s when they
  stop. Off unless `LOBBY_COORDINATOR=api` and the site's `sharedLobbies`
  registry flag is on. Zero client changes — the merged list arrives through
  the existing feed, and joining a foreign lobby already routes by its
  letter.
- **Cluster registry:** pulled forward as "Server list v2" below.

# Server list v2: the API picks the server, the page comes from the CDN

Status: in progress (Sept 2026). Everything above stays: letter-prefixed
ids, per-game routing, draining, `numWorkers` frozen per letter. What
changes is **where the server list lives** and **how a player reaches a
server**. The pieces land dormant, behind fallbacks, before the v34 cut;
the switch-overs are API and infrastructure operations afterwards.

## Why

Today two things decide where players go and must agree: the Cloudflare
load balancer (which color serves the page) and `CLUSTER_JSON` baked into
that page (where its games go). Switching colors is a load-balancer change
that servers learn about by polling the apex; adding a host means editing
`CLUSTER_JSON` and redeploying every server. And because a game server
renders the page, every value it writes in must also be supplied by the
Steam build, which renders the same template itself (#5310 blanked it,
patched in openfront-desktop #55).

Goal: one place decides where players go (the API), and nothing else (DNS,
a load balancer, the page) has to change at the same moment.

## The server list

`GET https://api.<audience>/cluster.json?site=<host>` — `site` is the
hostname players load the page from (`openfront.io`, `main.openfront.dev`,
`<branch>.openfront.dev`). Every site has its own list and its own
`latest`; previews never appear in main's list.

```json
{
  "latest": "bfd5563a…",
  "servers": {
    "c": {
      "host": "falk2-a.openfront.io",
      "numWorkers": 16,
      "version": "5ccc50a7…",
      "state": "draining"
    },
    "d": {
      "host": "falk2-b.openfront.io",
      "numWorkers": 16,
      "version": "bfd5563a…",
      "state": "open"
    },
    "e": {
      "host": "nbg2-a.openfront.io",
      "numWorkers": 8,
      "version": "3a1f90bb…",
      "state": "fenced"
    }
  }

| `state`      | `open`: runs `latest`, so it takes new games from clients on that build. `draining`: runs an older build, and still takes new games from clients on **that** build. `fenced`: takes nothing new; live games and rejoins still work. |

`color` is gone. Letters are append-only and never reused; retired letters
stay in the API but are not sent to clients. Everyone gets the same
response and the client filters it by version, so the API can cache it
for a few seconds. Commits are compared prefix-tolerantly (a 7+ char
prefix of a sha matches it), so short and full forms interoperate.
`latest` and `version` must both be commit-shaped (`/^[0-9a-f]{7,40}$/i`):
they decide which server a build may use, and (for a pinned game page) go
into `/v/<commit>/`. Both compares only work on commit-shaped values, so a
list carrying anything else is rejected whole and the client keeps its own
values.

### A non-`open` server stops offering ranked matches too (OPE-469)

`draining`, standby and `fenced` all stop new games, and that includes ranked
ones. Each worker long-polls the API's matchmaking check-in to volunteer as
the host for the next match (`src/server/RankedCheckin.ts`); it now makes that
offer only while the deployment-active flag the master pushes over
`lobbiesBroadcast` is true — the flag the check-in reply sets
(`ClusterCheckin.applyCheckinState`). Games already assigned or running are
untouched; only the next offer is withheld, and the worker defaults to active
until its master says otherwise. The check-in also carries the server's own
commit as `version` (omitted when `GIT_COMMIT` names no commit), so the
Lobby can refuse to assign a match to a server on a different build than the
players — the contract form of the same rule (OPE-470). Without this, blue ran v0.34.0 as `draining`
while every `openfront.io` page served green's v0.34.1, blue's workers kept
claiming matches, and players on the new build were assigned a blue game, got
`version_mismatch`, went to fetch blue's build, and arrived past the start
deadline — so the match cancelled short-handed and the game was pruned before
they could connect ("Connection refused: Game not found").

### The ranked queue is keyed by site (infra #738)

A matched game id is resolved through the player's server list, so the only
servers that can host a page's match are the ones registered under the site
that list is read for. The API keeps one ranked queue per `site:mode`, and
both sides name their site:

- **The client join** sends `site=<matchmakingSite()>`
  (`src/client/ServerList.ts`): `serverListSite()` — the apex for a page
  behind one, `<subdomain>.<DOMAIN>` under GAME_DOMAIN, the desktop's pinned
  server host, the same value it fetches `/cluster.json` for — passed
  through the shape check below.
- **The worker check-in** sends `site` as `ClusterCheckin.registeredSite()`:
  `SITE_HOST`, else its own public host — the site it registers under.

Either is sent only when it is a name the API's `SiteSchema` accepts
(`isSiteLike` in `src/core/ServerList.ts`: a lowercase hostname, no port), for
the same reason `version` is only sent when commit-shaped — the API refuses a
malformed value rather than treating it as absent. A side that sends none
lands in the legacy `shared` pool, where it still meets the other legacy side.

The API also checks the site's registry at assignment: the offered id's
letter must be registered under that site and `open`, or the offer is
released and the next server tried. That is the second guard on the OPE-469
rule above — a server on an old build, or one that never learned its state,
keeps offering, and now its offer is checked against what the site's players
actually see in `GET /cluster.json`.

Why: on 15 Sept 2026 every branch preview on the staging host deployed as
letter `a` and checked into the same API, so `main.openfront.dev` — same
letter and build as blue — won openfront.dev's matches, and the client polled
blue for a game that lived on a host its list could not name.

## What the client does (`src/client/ServerList.ts`, `src/core/ServerList.ts`)

- **Fetched at page load, then a heartbeat.** `startServerListPolling()`
  runs early in `Client.initialize()`: the first fetch overlaps with the
  rest of boot, and the list is refreshed every 30s on success. Each fetch
  is bounded (4s), so offline singleplayer waits seconds at worst and never
  hangs.
- **A hidden tab does not beat, and neither does one in a match.** A beat
  that comes due while `document.hidden`, or while a match is running
  (`setServerListInGame`, called from `Main.setInGameSignal`), is skipped
  and runs when the pause lifts — never sooner than it was due, so switching
  tabs or leaving a match adds no requests. Nobody can click Join from
  either state, the desktop status bar hides itself in-game, a running game
  already knows its server, and `ensureServerList()` serves the cached list
  whatever its age, so the only cost is a list that is revalidated on return
  instead of while nobody was looking.
- **Failed attempts back off.** `retryDelayMs(consecutiveFailures)` is the
  schedule, and it is a pure function so it can be read without a clock: 10s
  after the first unanswered attempt, doubling on each further consecutive
  one (20s, 40s), capped at 60s. Any answer below a 500 — a 404 included —
  resets it to the base, so a page that recovers and then misses once is
  retried in 10s rather than inheriting the old outage's wait; a 5xx counts
  as unanswered. The base is
  short because the common case is a blip the next request clears; the cap
  exists because a lid-closed laptop should not fire a request every 10s all
  night, and by a minute in the player who is still waiting has the Retry
  button. The success cadence (30s) is untouched by any of this.
- **A click never waits when a list is known.** `ensureServerList()`
  answers from the cached list whatever its age and revalidates behind the
  answer (stale-while-revalidate); only a page that has never got a list
  waits for a fetch — the one in flight, or one it starts. A page with no
  list whose last attempt failed less than the current backoff delay ago
  starts none: it answers `fallback` and leaves retrying to the heartbeat,
  so a caller on a timer (the matchmaking poll, every second) cannot hammer
  a down API.
- **A failed refresh keeps the last good list.** Network error, timeout,
  non-OK, malformed or empty: the previous list keeps serving. The API
  caches its answer for seconds anyway, so a blip must not flip a working
  page into fallback. Only a client that never got a list falls back.
- **Reachability (two signals, OPE-439):** `backendReachable()` is the raw
  per-attempt answer — null until the first attempt settles, true when the
  API answered with anything below a 500 (a 404 included: reachable, but no
  list for this site), false on a timeout, a network error or a 5xx. It is
  deliberately twitchy, so nothing player-facing gates on it.
  `backendUnreachableConfirmed()` is the debounced one the UI uses: true
  only once **two** attempts in a row have gone unanswered, which takes the
  base retry delay (10s) to accumulate — the backoff only stretches once
  there is an outage to back off from, so confirmation is never slowed by
  it. One missed beat is a blip the cached list serves straight through, and
  dimming multiplayer for 10s over it would be worse than the blip; any
  answer resets the count. Every change to either value is announced on the
  document as `backend-reachability` with `{ reachable, confirmed }`.
  Consumers seed from the accessor and then subscribe — the event is
  one-shot, so a component mounting afterwards would otherwise never learn
  the state (OPE-396).
- **Busy (a third signal):** `attemptInFlight()` says whether an attempt is
  out right now, automatic or manual, and every start and settle is
  announced as `server-list-attempt` with `{ inFlight }`. Separate from
  `backend-reachability` because that one fires only on a **change**: an
  attempt that fails exactly like the last one announces nothing, which is
  precisely the case the Retry button has to see.
- **Retry:** `retryServerList()` is the player-initiated attempt. It
  ignores the heartbeat's backoff (a person pressing a button is not a
  timer, and once an outage has run a while that wait is up to a minute) but
  has a 1s floor of its own, inside which a second press hands back the same
  promise; past that, `fetchOnce()` still dedupes against an attempt already
  in flight. A retry that fails counts towards the outage confirmation like
  any other attempt.

  The floor is the last line of defence rather than the first. Above it sits
  one policy, `manualRetryAvailable()`, shared by the two affordances that
  reach `retryServerList` and reading one clock: no retry while any server-list attempt is in flight
  (`attemptInFlight()` / `server-list-attempt`), whoever started it, and
  none for `MANUAL_RETRY_COOLDOWN_MS` (5s) after the last player-initiated
  one — a stubbed or fast failure settles in milliseconds and would
  otherwise hand the affordance straight back to a player clicking at an
  outage.

  The affordances:
  - **Desktop:** the status bar's offline Retry, disabled under either
    condition above so it comes back whenever the later of them ends. During
    an automatic attempt it reads `desktop_status.retrying` rather than
    sitting greyed out for no visible reason.
  - **Web:** there is no status bar, so the refused click _is_ the retry.
    `reportMultiplayerRefusal` probes when `manualRetryAvailable()` says it
    would do something, and raises the `common.backend_unreachable` toast
    either way — which is what makes that toast's "try again" true. Without
    it a web player's only way out would be the heartbeat's next beat, up to
    `RETRY_MAX_MS` away.
  - **Both:** the Retry in the homepage's lobby slot, shown when the public
    lobby feed has given up or an outage is confirmed (never on a gated
    desktop session, where the status bar owns the remedy). It holds itself
    for the same cooldown but does not share the clock: it goes through
    `refreshServerList()`, which has a 1s floor of its own and otherwise
    joins the attempt already in flight or starts one, so a
    `PublicLobbySocket.start` with `refreshList` never dials from a list
    older than the answer it could have had.

- **What reachability may gate, and what it may not.** The rule, stated
  once at the top of `GameModeSelector.ts` and referenced from every call
  site: the signal is the health of **one** thing, the server-list API. It
  is not a general "is the network up" light, and it says nothing about
  whether any given _game_ server is up. So it gates exactly the actions
  that cannot begin until that API answers, because nothing has yet told the
  client which server to talk to.
  - _Gated (API-dependent):_ Create/host a lobby, Ranked/matchmaking, and
    the join-by-code modal, in `GameModeSelector`. These dim and refuse a
    press — `shouldBlockMultiplayerAction` with
    `backendUnreachableConfirmed()` — on the web as well as on desktop.
  - _Not gated (socket-sourced):_ every public or hosted lobby card, in the
    homepage selector and in `DetailedGameViewModal` alike, and every join
    that reaches `Main`'s funnel. These call
    `shouldBlockSocketSourcedAction`, the same predicate with the
    reachability input nailed shut, so a card neither dims nor refuses over
    a list-API outage; `DetailedGameViewModal` does not subscribe to the
    signal at all.

  A card is in front of the player because a game server sent it over a
  socket that is still open, which is the only liveness that join needs.
  Likewise every join source has already reached a server to produce its
  event — `private` after `checkActiveLobby` read `exists` from the game's
  own server, `host` after `createLobby` minted the id, `public` from that
  live lobby feed, `matchmaking` after the queue matched. Refusing on the
  list API's health could only ever reject a join that is already under way,
  and at worst would eject a player whose reload had just proved their game
  is live. Single-player is never gated either way, and nothing here touches
  a game already in progress.

- **Which list:** the desktop shell asks for its injected `serverHost`
  (its values are exactly the sites); a web page asks for its `siteHost`
  when rendered behind an apex, else `window.location.host`. Decided with
  `isDesktopShell()`, not by whether `serverHost` is present — game
  servers inject `serverHost` as their own host, which is not a site.
- **New game or lobby list:** a random `open` server whose `version`
  matches the client's `gitCommit`; if none does, a random `draining`
  server on that same build. Never a `fenced` one. The pick is sticky for
  the page while that server still takes this build's games — a flip from
  `open` to `draining` does not move it. `ClientEnv.serverWsBase()` /
  `serverHttpBase()` / `numWorkers()` answer from it.
- **A server-rendered page prefers its own server** (`ownLetterIn` +
  `servesBuild`, ahead of the draw and of stickiness): when the list carries
  the page's own server — matched on the injected `serverHost`, else on the
  page's own letter — and that entry is `open` or `draining` on this build,
  that letter is the pick. Only when the list carries no such entry, or it
  does not serve this build, does the random pick decide. A Worker-served
  page names no server and is unaffected.
- **Existing game** (link, rejoin, matchmade id): the id's letter names
  the server in the list, whatever its state. `ClientEnv.resolveGame()`
  answers from the list; an unknown letter means the game doesn't exist
  (no apex redirect: the list is the freshest there is).
- **Fallback:** while no list has ever loaded — missing, unreachable,
  malformed or empty — every accessor answers from `BOOTSTRAP_CONFIG`
  exactly as before, so production behaves as today until the API serves a
  list.
- **No server for my build** (nothing `open` and nothing `draining` on it;
  a `fenced` server does not count):
  - on a page that names a server of its own — every page today — the
    answer is `fallback`: that server rendered this page, so it is the
    server for this build, and the list gets no say over whether the page
    is up to date. See "Who may be told to update" below; this is the
    OPE-430 rule, and the rest of this bullet is about a page the static
    Worker served.
  - if the client _is_ `latest`, or the list has no `latest`, no server is
    running at all. Own-server calls fall back to the page's values and
    multiplayer fails as it does today (`ensureServerList()` answers
    `no-server`).
  - otherwise the client is behind: `ensureServerList()` answers
    `outdated`. **Nothing navigates the page.** `PublicLobbySocket.start`
    fires its existing `onUpdateAvailable` once — the same callback a
    differing `gitCommit` in the lobby feed uses — so
    `GameModeSelector.handleUpdateAvailable` shows the existing "update
    available" prompt and `reloadForUpdate()` reloads (a plain reload: by
    the time a build has no server left, the edge cache has long moved
    on). It connects anyway, so a shell that never prompts still gets its
    lobby list from the fallback values.
  - never prompted: a page a game server rendered (see below); the desktop
    shell, whose updater owns which version it runs; a replay shell, pinned
    to the archived game's build on purpose; and a build whose `gitCommit`
    names no commit (`DEV`, `desktop`), which matches every version and so
    is never behind.
  - this replaces the `/v/<latest>/` redirect an earlier draft had.
    Rollover keeps today's feel instead: a player on build X keeps playing
    on X's `draining` server after Y is released, until they refresh. A
    version mismatch on join is still answered at join time
    (`version_mismatch`). `/v/<commit>/` is now used only for pinned pages
    of existing games and replays — roadmap item 2.

### Who may be told to update, and when (OPE-430)

`outdated` is a statement about what a RELOAD would fetch, so it belongs to
one kind of page only: one that names no server of its own.

- A **Worker-served** page carries no `serverHost` and no `cluster` +
  `instanceLetter` (`ClientEnv.servedByGameServer()` is false). Reloading it
  really does fetch `latest` from the static Worker, so "you are behind,
  reload" is both true and effective there.
- A **server-rendered** page — which, until the Worker is routed, is every
  page — was rendered BY a game server running exactly this build, and a
  reload re-fetches the page from that same host. There is nothing for the
  list to move it to, so `apply()` answers `fallback` whatever the list says
  about that host (absent from it, listed on another build, listed and
  fenced): the page's own server and its own values, exactly as when the API
  is unreachable. The list is still applied, so foreign letters keep routing
  cross-host (`resolveGame`), and `Api.createLobby` creates on the page's own
  server — as Create did before the list existed.

Without that rule, one deploy that fails to register strands every visitor.
On `main.openfront.dev` the list carried no server on the page's build and a
`latest` that was a different commit; the lobby socket raised "a new version
of OpenFront is available", the reload re-served the same page from the same
server, and it prompted again — forever. That was OPE-430.

A server-rendered page is not left behind by this, because it does not need
the list to find out. The server it is talking to tells it, over the lobby
feed it is already connected to: a different `gitCommit` (that host has moved
on) or `active: false` (its deployment is no longer the live one — `draining`,
`fenced` and a refused check-in all set it, see
`ClusterCheckin.applyCheckinState`). That
is the pre-v2 mechanism, it cannot loop — the signal comes from the very host
a reload goes back to — and it covers the stale tab, the rollover and the
fenced own server alike.

#### The one thing a feed cannot say: nothing at all

A tab that was sitting on the homepage when its deployment was drained and
then fenced or removed never gets a feed to learn from; it just watches its
socket fail. Once `PublicLobbySocket` has given up after `maxWsAttempts`,
`promptIfOutdated` asks `ServerList.reloadWouldRescue(status)`: would
reloading actually land this tab somewhere better? Three conditions, all
necessary:

1. **The list has no server for this build** (the status is not `api`). A
   picked server still takes this build's games, so a socket failing against
   it is a network blip — and being behind `latest` is the normal state of
   every tab for the length of a rollout, so prompting on `api` would turn
   every hiccup in that window into a forced reload.
2. **There is a newer build to go to** (`behindLatest`: the list names a
   `latest` that is not this one), with the desktop, replay-shell and
   pinned-page exemptions applied — those pages must never be told to reload
   at all.
3. **A reload can land somewhere other than this page's own server.** This is
   a question about TOPOLOGY, not liveness, because a browser cannot
   establish liveness: the master's `/api/health` sends no CORS headers, so a
   cross-origin probe fails whatever the server's state, and an opaque
   (`no-cors`) response carries no status at all — a proxy answering 521 for
   a torn-down origin and a healthy server look the same. What the page does
   know for certain is where its reload goes. `reloadForUpdate()` re-enters
   through `siteHost`, so the reload can land elsewhere only when `siteHost`
   is defined, is not the page's own server host, **and** the page's cluster
   map has siblings. That last check is what catches a standalone deployment
   with `GAME_DOMAIN` set: its page host (`main.openfront.dev`) and game host
   (`main.server.openfront.dev`) differ, yet Traefik routes both names to the
   one container, so a differing `siteHost` alone proves nothing — the same
   rule the server's own apex poll uses (`shouldPollApex`).

A server-rendered page prefers its own server because the page and the
registry can disagree about a sibling while the page's own server is, by
construction, right about itself. A server learns its drain state from its
check-in reply, so for up to one check-in interval after the registry moves
`open` between siblings, the list can call a server `open` whose lobby feed
still reports `active: false`. A page rendered by blue that drew green in that
window would read the feed as "a new version is available" and reload.

Nothing in the table navigates the page by itself: the prompt is the existing
one-shot `onUpdateAvailable` → `GameModeSelector.handleUpdateAvailable` →
`reloadForUpdate()`, and opening a game whose server runs another build is a
separate decision (below).

## The static page: booting with no server of its own

Roadmap item 2. A page built once per version and served to everyone can
only carry what is the same for every player, so `ClientEnv` splits the
values it reads in two.

**Required (the environment):** `gameEnv`, `turnstileSiteKey`,
`jwtAudience`, `gitCommit` (plus the optional `assetManifest` / `cdnBase`).
A page missing one of these has no environment to run in and still throws
`Missing BOOTSTRAP_CONFIG`.

**Optional (a server):** `cluster`, `instanceLetter`, `numWorkers`,
`serverHost`, `siteHost`, `instanceId`. A server that renders the page
still injects them all, and every accessor prefers the API's list and falls
back to them — so nothing changes until the pipeline uploads
environment-only pages. `instanceId()` reads `""` when absent, and
`Matchmaking` then leaves the parameter off the join URL entirely (the API
ignores it either way).

**`NoServerError`** (exported from `src/client/ClientEnv.ts`) is thrown when
no server is known at all — no list loaded, nothing injected — by
`numWorkers()` and `workerPath()`. A worker count is a property of ONE
server, so there is no answer to fall back on: any number routes to a worker
that does not own the game.

`serverWsBase()` / `serverHttpBase()` deliberately do NOT throw. With
nothing injected the document's own origin is the historical answer, and on
a dev box or a standalone deployment it is the CORRECT one — the game server
is what served the page. On a static page it is wrong, but wrong in the way
that surfaces as an ordinary connection failure rather than as a refusal to
build a URL.

Callers either await `ensureServerList()` first or handle the throw:
`LobbySocket.start` routes it into its existing connection-error path
(the same alert a refused socket produces), and `createLobby` lets it
propagate to callers that already catch. Share links never throw:
`ClientEnv.gamePath(gameID)` returns `/w<n>/game/<id>` when a worker count
is known for that id (from the list by letter, else this page's own) and
plain `/game/<id>` when none is. Both shapes are served — the game server's
SPA fallback and the static Worker — and the join flow re-resolves the
worker from the id anyway.

## Opening a game at its server's version

Roadmap item 2, the other half. The list says which commit each server runs,
so a page can tell before joining that the game it was asked to open lives
on a different build — a link into a version still draining, or a page served
as `latest` after a deploy.

`ClientEnv.gameVersion(gameID)` reads that commit (undefined with no list, or
for a letter the list doesn't carry, or for a legacy id with no letter), and
`redirectToGameVersion(gameID)` in `src/client/ServerList.ts` is the whole
decision, exported so the three places a game is opened cannot drift apart —
`Main.handleUrl`'s `/game/<id>` branch, `JoinLobbyModal.checkActiveLobby` and
`MatchmakingModal.checkGame`, each after `ensureServerList()`. It never
navigates the two shells that have no `/v/<commit>/` routes to go to:

- **desktop**, whose updater owns which version it runs (a mismatch there
  stays `update_available.desktop`);
- **a replay shell**, where `replay.<domain>/<gameId>` serves the build a
  record was made on. It does load the site's list — `siteHost` is injected
  there — so nothing else would stop it, and a navigation would 404 and lose
  an archived replay.

The rest is `versionedPathForGame(ownCommit, gameVersion, pathname, search)`
in `src/core/ServerList.ts`, which answers null (stay here, join as today)
when:

- the version is unknown — a navigation on a guess is worse than joining and
  finding out;
- the versions match, including a build whose own label names no commit
  (`DEV`, `desktop`), which matches anything;
- the page already lives under `/v/<gameVersion>/` yet still isn't that
  build — the version's page isn't being served (before the static Worker
  exists, say). That is the loop guard, and falling through hands the
  mismatch to join-time `version_mismatch`, whose redirect already answers
  it.

The matchmaking modal asks at one specific moment, and not before: the poll
that waits for the matched game to be created runs every second and must
never navigate, so the question comes after `/exists` answers true and
immediately before the `join-lobby` dispatch. A ranked match cannot afford
the join-time answer (OPE-471): matchmaking pairs players by rating rather
than by build, so a page served as `latest` is routinely matched onto a
server still draining the previous one, and being bounced at join time costs
a whole page boot — long enough that the match's start deadline passes and
the server cancels it (OPE-469).

That is also why join-time `version_mismatch` (`ClientGameRunner`) now tries
this page's own host first: `versionedPathForMismatchedGame` asks the same
question as the redirect above and answers the `/v/<commit>/` path on the
host already loaded. It asks it of the refusing server's own `gitCommit`
first — that server has just said which build it runs, where the list is
stale-while-revalidate and may still name the version the join was attempted
on — and of the list only when the server names no commit at all. A
`GIT_COMMIT` that is not commit-shaped (`DEV`, `unknown`) counts as naming
none: it would otherwise build a dead `/v/unknown/` URL instead of falling
through to the recovery below. Only when there
is no such page — versions match, an exempt shell, or the page is already
pinned to the commit the server names — does it fall through to the
cross-host, pinned and reload branches described below. Its loop guard reads
the pin captured at boot rather than the address bar, which the join has
already rewritten to the version-free share URL.

### A pinned page is never "outdated"

A document under `/v/<commit>/` is pinned ON PURPOSE, so it is never reported
`outdated` however far behind `latest` it is — decided in `isOutdated`
(`src/client/ServerList.ts`) rather than at the call sites, so no future
caller of `ensureServerList` can get it wrong.

Being behind is the point. The one flow that puts a player on a pinned page
is opening a game whose server runs an older build, so the page is behind by
construction and _permanently_ — unlike an ordinary tab, where being behind
is news ("a deploy happened while you were here") and the prompt is a
one-shot. Prompting here would fire on every visit, and its remedy
(`reloadForUpdate`, which strips the prefix) would silently undo the pin the
player asked for. Leaving is already one click away: "leave to the menu" goes
to the version-free root. Same exemption, and the same reason, as the desktop
and replay shells.

A pinned page needs no special treatment beyond that: its build's servers are
`draining`, not `fenced`, so the ordinary "an open server on my build, else a
draining one" pick already routes it to one, and Create and the lobby feed
work there like anywhere else.

The one loop it must not enter runs through join-time `version_mismatch`
(`ClientGameRunner`). `reloadForUpdate` strips the pin — right for an
ordinary stale tab, wrong here: the reload lands on `latest`, whose
`handleUrl` sees the same game on the same older server and pins the page
straight back, one lap per click. So a pinned page whose server names the very
commit it is pinned to says `update_available.message` and stops: nothing it
can fetch is the build it needs — that is precisely what a mismatch there
means, the version's page is not being served. A pin naming some OTHER commit
is an ordinary mismatch, and takes the versioned page for that commit (else
the game's own host when the id resolves cross-host) — at most one hop before
the guard above catches it.

## Paths on a `/v/<commit>/` page

Every version's page is also served under `/v/<commit>/`, immutably, so a
document may live under that prefix and every same-origin path it builds or
parses has to account for it.

- **Parsing:** `Main.handleUrl`'s game-id match accepts an optional
  `/v/<commit>` prefix ahead of the optional `/w<n>` one.
- **Staying put:** every `history.pushState` / `replaceState` builds from
  `window.location.pathname` (`ModalRouter`, `consumeRequeueUrl`), or from
  `currentPagePath()` (`src/client/Utils.ts`), which re-applies the page's own
  `/v/<commit>/` to a path built from scratch. A history entry is this tab's
  own URL, so F5 on it must reload THE BUNDLE THIS PAGE IS RUNNING; a
  version-free entry would hand a pinned player `latest` mid-game. Six places
  build a game path from scratch; five of them use it: the in-game `?live`
  entry, the invite navigation, `AccountModal.viewGame`,
  `PlayerProfileModal.viewGame` and `ClanGameHistoryView.watchReplay`. The
  sixth, `updateJoinUrlForShare`, is the deliberate exception below.
- **Share links stay version-free**, including the address-bar URL
  `updateJoinUrlForShare` writes, which is exactly what people copy to
  invite someone. The recipient must be routed to the version the GAME'S
  server runs when they open it, which `handleUrl` → `redirectToGameVersion`
  does. Pinning that URL would hand them the inviter's build instead.
- **`homeHref()`** returns the version-free `/`. "Leave to the menu" should
  land the player on `latest`, not back on the build they were leaving.
- **`reloadForUpdate()`** strips the prefix (`stripVersionPrefix`, or
  `apexPathFor` when it also leaves for the apex). `/v/<commit>/` pins the
  bundle, so reloading it as-is re-serves the very version the update is
  leaving behind — forever, cache-buster or not.

## `latest`: the one switch

Each site has one `latest` commit. The build pipeline sets it once the new
version's servers have registered; rollback is an admin-panel action that
flags an older commit. The API refuses to flag a commit with no servers
checked in. Everything follows from it: servers on `latest` are `open`,
older ones `draining` (still serving their own build's clients) until they
are `fenced` and their games run out; `<site>/` (any path without
`/v/<commit>/`) serves its page; `/desktop/*.json` points the Steam build
at it. One value, not two, so the default page and the servers' states can
never disagree.

For a client, `latest` is only ever a comparison — it is never navigated
to. A page whose build still has an `open` or `draining` server keeps
using it and ignores `latest` entirely; only a page with no server left at
all looks at `latest`, and a value differing from its own build is what
turns into the "update available" prompt.

## Roadmap (what lands where)

1. **Client reads the list** (this repo, above). Dormant until the API
   serves a list.
2. **Client tolerates a static page** (below).
3. **Servers register and check in** with the API (letter, host, version,
   worker count, live games, machine) every ~10s, and the reply is always
   obeyed: only `open` schedules public lobbies. A deployed server schedules
   none until its first `open`, and a `409` (the letter is bound to another
   host) stops it and is logged as an error; an unreachable API changes
   nothing.

   `machine` is the **box** a container runs on — `falk2`, `nbg2`, `staging`
   — not a hostname: it is deploy.sh's machine argument, written into the
   container's env as `MACHINE` and read back by `ServerEnv.machine()`. The
   registry needs it because blue and green frequently share a machine, so
   "one open server per site" and "one open server per **machine**" are
   different rules, and only the second one actually buys redundancy: a flip
   to a colour on the same box survives nothing the first colour would not
   have survived. Enforcement is the registry's (infra, OPE-455); this repo
   only reports the value, and omits the key entirely when `MACHINE` is unset
   or is not a plain label, so a bad value can never cost a server its
   registration.

4. **Pipeline:** `RenderStaticIndex` renders an environment-only page per
   site and uploads it with the desktop descriptor; a final step flags the
   version as `latest` once its servers have registered. Landed (#5369);
   detailed below.
5. **API (not bound by the cut):** the registry, check-in, `GET
/cluster.json`, set-latest, admin rollback, and a static-page Worker on
   the site hostname reading only the public bucket (`/v/<commit>/…`
   immutable, everything else `latest`'s page, `/desktop/*.json`).

Previews keep parity: every push deploys the branch's own server (same
container, same 25h cap) and the branch's page talks only to it, under its
own site. Matching is on the exact commit, never on core version: a branch
can change server code without touching `src/core`.

## Roadmap item 4 in detail: the publish pipeline

Every deploy already uploads the build's hashed assets to R2 and a
fully-rendered `index-<short>.html` replay shell next to them. `update.sh`
now also publishes, per **site** and per **version**, the three objects the
static Worker will serve. The site is `SITE_HOST` when the deployment sits
behind a load balancer, else `<subdomain>.<domain>`; the version is the
7-character prefix of `static/commit.txt`. All uploads go through
`PUT $R2_ENDPOINT/game_assets/upload/<urlencoded key>`, which prefixes
`game_assets/`:

| Object                                        | Rendered by                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `sites/<site>/v/<short>/index.html`           | `RenderStaticIndex.ts --environment-only`      |
| `sites/<site>/v/<short>/desktop/release.json` | `RenderDesktopDescriptor.ts`                   |
| `sites/<site>/v/<short>/desktop/version.json` | `RenderDesktopDescriptor.ts --version-pointer` |
| `sites/<site>/v/<short>/root-files.json`      | the build (`writeRootFilesIndex`)              |
| `sites/<site>/v/<short>/root/<path>`          | copied from `static/`, one per index entry     |

Everything in `resources/public/` (the policy pages, `robots.txt`, `ads.txt`,
`press/`, and Apple Pay's `.well-known/` file) is served verbatim at the site
root. The site Worker has no origin behind it, so it serves these from R2:
`root-files.json` maps each path to its content type (plus a `"<dir>/"` entry
for a directory with an `index.html`), and the Worker serves exactly what it
lists. To publish a new root file, add it to `resources/public/`.

Both renderers run inside the freshly built image with the live container's
env file, exactly as the replay shell already does, so what is published is
what that build's server would itself have produced.

**The page carries no server.** `renderHtmlContent(path, { perServer: false })`
omits `cluster`, `instanceLetter`, `instanceId`, `serverHost` and `siteHost`;
`index.html` guards those lines the way it already guarded `serverHost`, so a
render that supplies them is byte-for-byte what it always was. That is what
lets one page be cached and served to every player of a version — the client
asks the API which server to use. The legacy `index-<short>.html` upload keeps
the server values until OPE-431 lands, because today's client throws without a
worker-count source.

**The descriptors move earlier, not elsewhere.** `release.json` and
`version.json` are the same objects `/desktop/*.json` serves today, from the
same `buildDescriptor`; publishing them per version lets the Worker answer for
a site with no game server reachable, and makes a rollback a pointer flip.
`release.json`'s `template.html` is the raw EJS template by design: the Steam
shell renders it itself.

**Flagging `latest`.** After the new container is running, `update.sh` calls
`POST $R2_ENDPOINT/cluster/latest` with `{ site, version }` (version is the
full sha). The API refuses a version no server has checked in for, so a `409`
right after `docker run` is expected and is retried every 5s for up to 90s —
servers register within ~10s of boot. Outcomes:

- `200` / `204` — logged, done.
- `404` — the API predates the registry; warn and continue.
- `400` / `401` / `403` — a bad key or a malformed request. No retry can fix
  it, so the deploy fails at once.
- `409` (or an unreachable API) after the retries — the deploy fails. Clients
  take the server list from the API, so an unflagged version means no server
  is `open` and nobody can start a game; reporting success would be false.

Until the Worker exists nothing reads any of this, so the uploads are additive
and prod is unaffected. The decision table above is unit-tested in
`tests/UpdateFlagLatest.test.ts`, which extracts the real function out of
`update.sh` and drives it with a scripted `curl`.

### Two hostnames per deployment

A deployment answers on two names, and they do different jobs:

| Name      | Is                          | Serves                                          |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| page host | `SITE_HOST`                 | the page: HTML, assets — soon a static Worker   |
| game host | `<subdomain>.<GAME_DOMAIN>` | the game: WebSockets, `/api/*` — this container |

The game host is `<subdomain>.<GAME_DOMAIN>` (or `<subdomain>.<DOMAIN>` with
`GAME_DOMAIN` unset) for a standalone deployment, and
`<subdomain>.<machine>.<GAME_DOMAIN>` for a fleet member whose cluster entry
carries the machine (the runbook above). deploy.sh resolves which by looking
the deployment up in the cluster map, machine-scoped name first, and writes
the answer into the container's env as `GAME_HOST`; `ServerEnv.publicHost()`,
the Traefik rule and the nginx self-match all read that rather than
re-deriving it. The page host is `SITE_HOST`, and what fills that in depends
on whether the deployment has siblings:

- **In a multi-entry cluster map** — prod's blue/green, and the dev blue/green
  pair — the page host is the **apex**: `openfront.io`, `openfront.dev`. That
  is genuinely where players load the page from, and `deploy.sh` has always
  defaulted `SITE_HOST` to `$DOMAIN` for these. `GAME_DOMAIN` does not change
  it.
- **Standalone** (`main`, `nightly`, beta, a branch preview) there is no apex,
  so with `GAME_DOMAIN` set `deploy.sh` fills `SITE_HOST` in with
  `<subdomain>.<DOMAIN>` — the deployment's own page name, which is what the
  Worker will serve. With `GAME_DOMAIN` unset it stays empty, as today, because
  page and game are then the same name anyway.

They have to be separate names because the static Worker will sit on the page
host and serve a cached page for every player of a version. Game traffic must
never pass through it: a Worker proxying WebSockets is an expense and a
failure mode for no gain, and the whole point of the server list is that the
client picks a game server itself.

Prod is already shaped this way — `openfront.io` is the page, `blue.openfront.io`
and `green.openfront.io` are the games — because the load balancer forced it.
`deploy.sh` therefore ignores `GAME_DOMAIN` entirely on prod: it is a
repository-level variable that every workflow inherits the day it is set, and
honouring it there would compute `blue.server.openfront.io`, which is in no
cluster map and resolves nowhere.
Dev was not: `main.openfront.dev` was both. `GAME_DOMAIN` is the one deploy
variable that gives a dev deployment the prod shape, e.g.
`GAME_DOMAIN=server.openfront.dev` makes `main` page at `main.openfront.dev`
and game at `main.server.openfront.dev`.

What follows from it:

- `DOMAIN` is unchanged everywhere it is used today: the JWT audience, the R2
  endpoint `api.$DOMAIN`, the page domain, the restart policy. `GAME_DOMAIN`
  only ever renames the game host.
- The cluster map names GAME hosts — it is the list of servers clients open
  sockets to. `deploy.sh` matches this box against it by its game host, and
  `ServerEnv.clusterSelf()` does the same on boot.
- Check-in reports both: `site` is the page host, `host` is the game host.
- Traefik matches both names during the transition, so the box keeps
  answering on the name people have bookmarked until the Worker is actually
  routed at the page host. After that the page-host clause never matches:

  ```
  Host(`main.openfront.dev`) || Host(`main.server.openfront.dev`)
  ```

- CI polls the GAME host for `commit.txt` when waiting for a deploy: the page
  host will be answered by the Worker, which knows nothing about a container's
  commit.
- The apex colour poll now also requires a cluster map with siblings. Every
  dev deployment has a `SITE_HOST` once `GAME_DOMAIN` is set, and a standalone
  one must not poll its own page host for `/api/health` — the Worker serves no
  such route, and with one entry there is no other colour to flip to anyway.
  The pair still polls, and it polls **through its page host**: the apex is how
  it learns which colour is live. So the Worker on the apex has to keep passing
  `/api/health` through to a server. (Superseded: the colour poll is gone and
  the check-in reply alone decides who drains.)

With `GAME_DOMAIN` unset the game host falls back to `<subdomain>.<DOMAIN>`,
which is exactly today's behaviour. That does not mean one hostname: a
deployment behind an apex still has two, because `SITE_HOST` is set
independently — prod's `blue` pages at `openfront.io` and games at
`blue.openfront.io` today, without `GAME_DOMAIN` existing at all. It is the
standalone deployments with no `SITE_HOST` — `main` and the branch previews —
where page and game really are the same name, and that is what this variable
changes. `deploy.sh` ignores it on prod outright, and dev leaves it unset until
the DNS wildcard and certificate for the game domain exist.
